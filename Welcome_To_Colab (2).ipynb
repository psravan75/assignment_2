        "\n",

        "   - When a function hits a return statement, it stops executing. No further code in that function is run after the return line.\n",
        "   - *Example:*\n",
        "     python\n",

        "- *How It Works:* An iterator must implement two methods: __iter__() and __next__(). The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself, and __next__() returns the next item. When there are no more items, __next__() raises the StopIteration exception.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. *Usage:*\n",
        "   - *Iterable:* Can be used directly in loops and comprehensions.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. *Creation:*\n",
        "   - *Iterable:* Usually created by built-in data structures (lists, tuples, etc.) or classes that define __iter__().\n",
        "   - *Iterator:* Created by calling iter() on an iterable, or by defining a class with __iter__() and __next__() methods.\n",

        "1. *Definition:*\n",
        "   - Generators are functions that produce a sequence of values over time, instead of computing them all at once and sending them back. They use the yield keyword to return values one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. *How They Work:*\n",
        "   - When you call a generator function, it doesn’t run the function immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object. Each time you ask for the next value using the next() function, the generator function runs until it hits a yield statement, which returns a value. The generator maintains its state, so it picks up where it left off the next time you ask for a value.\n",

        "\n",
        "Generators offer several benefits compared to regular functions, especially when working with large or complex sequences of data. Here’s why they can be advantageous:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. *Memory Efficiency:*\n",
        "   - *How It Helps:* Regular functions that return lists or other large collections need to store all the data in memory at once. This can be problematic if the data is huge or infinite. Generators, on the other hand, yield items one at a time and don’t store the entire sequence in memory. This makes them much more memory efficient.\n",
        "   - *Example:* If you’re processing a large log file line by line, using a generator means you only keep one line in memory at a time, instead of loading the whole file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. *Lazy Evaluation:*\n",
        "   - *How It Helps:* Generators use lazy evaluation, which means they generate items only when needed. This can be especially useful for operations where you don’t need all the data at once.\n",
        "   - *Example:* If you’re calculating a sequence of Fibonacci numbers, you can use a generator to produce numbers as needed rather than generating the whole sequence upfront.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. *Improved Performance:*\n",
        "   - *How It Helps:* Because generators yield items one at a time, they can start producing results quickly and handle large datasets efficiently without waiting for all data to be processed. This can lead to faster performance for certain tasks.\n",
        "   - *Example:* If you’re processing streaming data or data from a real-time source, generators can start yielding results immediately rather than waiting for all data to be available.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. *Simpler Code:*\n",
        "   - *How It Helps:* Generators can simplify your code by avoiding the need to manage the state of iteration manually. You don’t need to create and manage index variables or handle end-of-sequence conditions.\n",
        "   - *Example:* A generator that produces a sequence of numbers can replace complex loops and condition checks with a simple yield statement, making the code cleaner and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. *Handling Infinite Sequences:*\n",
        "   - *How It Helps:* Generators are perfect for dealing with infinite sequences because they don’t require the entire sequence to be generated or stored. They generate values on the fly as needed.\n",
        "   - *Example:* A generator that produces an infinite sequence of even numbers will keep producing numbers indefinitely without ever running out of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Memory Efficiency:* Generates items one at a time, saving memory.\n",
        "- *Lazy Evaluation:* Produces results as needed, not all at once.\n",
        "- *Improved Performance:* Handles large or real-time data efficiently.\n",
        "- *Simpler Code:* Makes code cleaner by managing iteration automatically.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. *Syntax:*\n",

        "     \n",
        "   - Here’s a simple example:\n",

        "3. *Inline Functions:*\n",
        "   - *Use Case:* Lambda functions are useful when you need a quick, throwaway function for a specific context and don’t want to clutter your code with additional function definitions.\n",
        "   - *Example:* If you want to sort a list of tuples by the second element:\n",
        "     python\n",
